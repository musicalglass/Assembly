So if you installed the recommended applications from the previous video, before you can use a couple of them, you need to set the Path in the Environment Variables. 
Lots of fun.

Maybe when you installed,
the applications left some icons up here on your desktop.
We won't be needing those really. 
You could double click on NASM. It won't even launch. It's not that type of application. It's meant to be run from the Command Line.
I do however like to drag Notepad++ down here into my Quick Launch bar, you know? But these we won't be needing. You can just trash those. 
We do however need to set up some Environment Variables. 
To get there you can go down here to the Search bar and type environ... 
just start typing environment till you see this, and then you hit Enter, 
and it takes us to the correct page on System Properties. And when you go down here and click on Environment Variables and select Path.
And now don't click New here. No. 
We want to select Edit, and then go New here. And then we'll go Browse like that. And we want to find our applications folder on the C: drive. Not your application... 
Program Files. There we go. First one, we're going to want NASM. There. 
Just select the folder, and go OK. That's all we need to do. 
New again. Browse.
And let's go back to the 
C: Program Files and go down a bit and find QEMU. Q E M U and click OK, and that's it. 
We're done setting those up.
We want to click OK, OK, OK 
or everything we just did is for nothing. OK? Okay! Great. 
  
Next thing we want to do... Let's see. So I'm going to open my File Explorer go to our Documents / Assembly and there's our test.asm. If I right click on that and go Open With,

Choose Another App. Okay, and then you select Always Open... Use this app to open. But Notepad++ probably won't appear on your list yet. So you have to go More Apps. 
And it won't be on that list either.
It is on mine because I've been using it. 
But probably ain't on yours.
So we gotta look for it in that Program Files. Find that again if it's not already queued as it is on mine. Notepad folder. And there. Notepad++. Double click or Open. There. Great!
Now from now on that's your preferred editor. 
So I could go now
to the Windows R Run Command Line go... Like here I want to go here. Left click here and all those foldery things disappear, and now the Path is selected. I can Ctrl C, go back over here, and just Right Click and Paste it... I'm sorry. Hang on.
I gotta go CD Space, 
Right click, Enter.
There. I'm in the Assembly folder. 
So now all I have to do is type Name of File. I can go T Tab for auto complete, hit Enter, and boom! It launches Notepad++ from the Command Line. Very nice. 
Another quick thing. Just to fake out the system here. Might as well. 
I'm just going to rename this real quick.
And it'll complain. I don't care. 
I'm gonna call it a .bin file. Boom.
Ooh! it might become unstable. Ooh, too bad! 
Okay, I'm gonna do the same thing now. I'm gonna say 
Open With
And we want our Hex Editor. 
Let's go more apps.
♫ La la la ♬ 
More Apps. HxD.
Right there. Hxd.exe. Open. 
OK. There. Wonderful.
Now we are set up to read binary files 
from our Command Line
using our Hex Editor. Wonderful! 
So that means I could... if I had a binary file
I could just call it by name. I don't... which, I just renamed that .bin .
So I could just call T Tab and it should launch it.
Yeah it is. 
Because it thinks it's a binary file at the moment. Great. Wonderful. 
So now our Hex Editor also works. Let's go back and change that back to the proper extension here. 
Documents / Assembly... there. That is not a .bin file. 
Rename it to an .asm file,
and we are good to go. So now, there. 
I can double click that. It will, or should always, launch Notepad++ from now on. There. Okay great. All set up, I think. Hopefully it all works. 
Okay, so all set up,
our Environment Variables. 
We can do everything we want to from the Command Line.

So let's do some of that
in the next tutorial.
