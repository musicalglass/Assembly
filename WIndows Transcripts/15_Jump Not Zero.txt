Here I guess I kind of
jumped to a conclusion, really. 
I'll show you.
First let's have a look.

It runs, and then it freezes, actually. It doesn't keep cycling. 
So something's not quite right there.

What is going on?
I didn't really count the numbers. 
You know, I just penciled something in
and it should have been 11.

And now if we look at it... It's fine.
Wonderful! 
It is in an endlessly happy loop there.
Great. Taken care of.

Let me just pencil this out just for a second here. OK 
We're on character 2 here.
What if I do... OK, there.

Character 2. Let's do something besides pink 
that's kind of nice.
Something easy on the eyes. 
I think I'll go just to... make this a light grey. Let's see.

Yeah OK. We've got our happy character.
OK. So what if character 1?

Yeah, uh huh.
Outline character. 
So if anybody after watching the Teletype tutorial decided to play around with some numbers 
you might have gotten some kind of unexpected results. 
So I'll talk about that. 
Essentially, if I go up to say, character number 6 here.

Save, and
lookie.

I get this symbol thing here.
And then if I go one higher here

I gets nothing.
And then if I put an 8 I get nothing, 
and 9 nothing, and nothing, and...
Oh! That's not very useful. I only got from 1-6. 
What's going on?
Let's have a look a little bit more

a little deeper then. Here

instead...

of an explicit value. Let's use a name.
We'll say print_loop I guess.

I will highlight,
CTRL ALT drag that there,

and at the end of it 
Colon. Turning it into a Label.
OK so that should still loop. 
This time
Let me..

INC AL
The value of the character here.

So each time it goes around the loop
it'll add 1 to this value.

Hang on. First
before I do that , let me check

sorry

Whoops. I closed my window.
So I have to go copy clipboard. 
Edit / Copy to Clipboard / Current Directory.
Go back there.

CD Space, right click,
Enter.

Back in my directory and

type S TAB
There's my commands.

Highlight and Enter, and Right click.

OK

I've been running... nothing there to see. OK why is that? Because..

Go back. Because I'm at the end of the printing characters there. 
Let's go back to character 1 here.
And just Save. Look at that real quick.

There. OK.
Looping, looping, looping. OK.

Now this time Increment the character by 1.

Am I Saved? Yeah.

There. So there's all the characters.
But what's going on is it gets... 
Starts at 0, goes to 255,
and then rolls over to 0 again. 
So you get this endless loop of characters. OK? So we'd like to... 
somehow if we can
make it stop!

and the way I am going to do that...

There might be a shorter way. But for learning purposes 
we no longer are going to need to clear these Registers 
I believe, because we're going to bring back our beloved CX value. 
CX... MOV something... Write something into CX.

And let's say it's just 6 for starters.

and then here
we'll take....

um, hang on, hang on!
Before I get one ahead of myself 
I don't need this yet. I'll do it this way
JNZ (Jump Not Zero)

Let me just run it
and then I'll explain it.

Bum! That's all of them.
And then when it gets to the end it stops. 
So what happens... it goes from 0 to 255, and then rolls over to 0.

Right? And then I said when it's not zero stop looping, essentially. 
OK? So to explain it a little deeper another way... 
as I was getting ahead of myself earlier with this... OK

The thing about that is....
Let's look at it one more time.

You can only make it stop here.
What if I want to make it stop here or something? 
How do I control how deep into the loop? You can only print out all the characters. 
Maybe I want to print out the first 6 characters there.

So we'll introduce CX

Put a value in there: 6.
And this is traditionally used as a Counter.

Some of the parts of the program will look here in CX automatically to see if there is a value in there to be counted.
In this case we're going to 
DEC CX
That's all we need to do.

and no I didn't explain. Yes I did.
Jump Not Zero

That Jump Not Zero is going to look at the last mathematical operation, which was here. 
Increment AL. And when you do that

the computer does some checking for a few different things 
and among them is whether or not the value is zero or non-zero. 
Right, and then it stores that

in either a 1 or 0 Binary Bit.
A Flag it's called.

So when you call Jump Not Zero it looks at whatever the last calculation 
mathematical operation was to see if a flag was set. 
Right, so it's looking here in AL

So when that condition changes,
then that changes here.

OK. This time...

I'll just go
DEC CX

So now it's going to be checking CX.
Whether that is true or not. 
OK, and here we are starting at a value of 6 and counting down. 
So let me Save that.

There.
So observe here it didn't print

character number 1. There's only 5 characters here. No there's 6. 1 2 3 4 5 6

But there's no 0 cause I didn't set 0.
What happens if I put 0 here now?

Bum bum! Zero. There we go. OK so now what if we go...

say
Counter, say, 12 characters?

OK here. Nah, nah... I'll save some time here.
I'm just beating around the bush. 8. 
8 characters.

Close that.

It's still the same 6 characters. Right?

OK and then if we go

9 characters

OK

still looking good. 10 characters.

The Spade has turned into some weird character. 
And then from here on out
if I keep adding 10, 11, 12, 13. 
I get nothing but a bunch of spaces.
So what's going on with the weirdness? 
Let me see if I can elaborate a little more by
changing this to

262
I think I'll go with

yes

Save, and look at it.

OK, here it has printed all the characters,
rolled around to zero and started again printing from the top
and this time 
let's see there is our club. Let me go 1 more. 263.

There's our Spade. Works fine.
So the thing is...

All this goes all the way back to the early days when this was a language for a Teletype machine. 
Even before there was what you would consider a modern day computer.

And so one teletype machine could communicate with another. 
Let's say you want to send a line of text and then have it stop here. 
Go to a new line and start printing some more characters or something. 
How do you tell the other machine to make a new line?

Well that's what's going on in here...
These other numbers are special 
Non Printing Characters.
They are reserved to tell the computer to do one thing or another
and in our case we got to what was it? 
8 or whatever was safe, and then 9, 10,
Something goes wrong. 
We can kind of see why.
Let's go to our trusty internet. 
I'm at asciitable.com
and there's the full ASCII table 
and a little more information than I can probably give you on the topic. 
Here we went to 8, Backspace.
9 Horizontal Tab. 
Ah! Backspace is what threw my... yeah
New Line. See? There's these 
Non Printing Commands that you can send
and one of them apparently sent a backspace and messed up the character or something like that.
But these are not even used anymore. 
These days they're just
handled differently now.

So all of that non printing characters from... 
0 is Null.
So always zero is nothing. 
Then you get to 32 is your first actual character it's also... 
nothing prints.
But if you're sending text.

A string of text and you want to put a Space in there, then you send a 32.

Because Null might tell the computer something else.

OK so yeah, you could go down to the numbers values. 
If you want to printout a number you start at 48, see? 
And then there's some more characters. 
If you want to print out the Alphabetical value, start at 65, see?

There you go. And capitals first, and then small lowercase letters like that. 
DEL. 
Ah! So when you roll around you may delete a character or something as well.

OK so that explains the Non Printing Characters.

There. All of that. So let me go back down to

No I don't have to

So yeah OK,
I'm going to Save this, I guess.

Save As, in our Lessons folder

That'd be
06_JumpNotZero.asm

Save

and have I missed anything else in the list?
No I guess that about covers it. 
There. So that's all your printable characters, right?

See one letter. Like I said you can also

of course you know

put in letter "H" directly 
but we'll deal with numbers and such in an upcoming episode.

Real quick let me just to finish marking this up correctly. 
That would be Jump Not Zero.
Yeah. 
Increment Character

and

We'll call it
Update Countdown

There. And go ahead and just
set that to 0.

Save as
05_JumpNotZero.asm

Yeah nice.
OK, call that a day.
