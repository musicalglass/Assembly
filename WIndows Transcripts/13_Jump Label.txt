The next kind of Jump Command 
if you've done any programming at all I'm sure you're familiar with the Label. 
So instead of counting Bytes
I just want to jump to say, here. 
So let's say ( here: )
and shift. 
That's Colon.
Not a semicolon.

And now there is a Label there.
So now I can say, 
instead of jump to a numerical value
I can say just JMP to "here:"

Let's try that. Save that.
Go over there and 
have a look.
There.

So it jumps over the first character to the second character. 
So then of course likewise I could from there jump back to there. I guess, right?

and then down here go
JMP to there.

Yeah see? That should create a loop, right? Some goofy loop. Figure 8 loop, I guess.

Up arrow

yeah yeah.

It's kind of like it's Little Endian.
It's in reverse. 
It prints the second character first
and the first one second.

So then you know of course

I can just say
Halt there.

CLI
HLT

For whatever reason. Just a quick demo.
There. So

I'll just ALT F4 outta there.

So program's comin along. La la la.
The computer's reading. It gets to here. 
It says jump to down there
and skip over the first character. 
And then it reads that.
And then when it gets to the bottom of that,
jump back up there, 
and la la then it reads and then
end of program.

And end of video.
