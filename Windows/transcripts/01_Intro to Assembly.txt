Yosh!

Welcome to another tutorial in plain English.

In this series I'll be covering some Assembly programming basics.

We will be working in a Windows environment. So starting from your desktop, you can just hold

down the Windows special key and hit R, and that should bring up the Run window. You can type CMD,

hit Enter, and that should launch a Command Prompt. Alternatively you can just click

here in the Search bar, type CMD. The first suggestion is correct. Just hit enter and,

there. We are in our Command Prompt. Alright I'd like to see what's in there. So I can

type DIR for DIRectories, and there is my list of Directories. In Windows they

call them folders. Here also referred to as Directories to further confuse you.

We want to be here in the Documents errr directory.

And so to get there I can go CD Space D O and hit the Tab key

and auto-complete fills that in for me. The first reference that begins with D O. Nice.

So I can just hit Enter and I'm in the Documents folder.

I'd like to make a new Directory (MKDIR)
like that, and we'll call it Assembly.

MKDIR Assembly, Enter, and we have created a new folder. I'm going to go into that folder now.

CD, and just hit, A Tab, Enter. There.

There we are. And now I'd like to create a new Assembly file so let me just go

ECHO and I'm going to write a little data byte in there. DB 0 just for starters and then use the

little arrow (>), which is shift period basically,
and we'll just name it test.asm .

There. We have successfully created our first Assembly program.

You may proceed to the next lesson,

or stick around and I'll give some further explanation, a little more in-depth.

So you can see, here we have created a program called test.asm. We can look at

it. I can just here type T Tab, autocomplete, and Enter. And since I have just installed a

fresh Windows operating system, there isn't any default setup yet. So I'll just go with

Notepad and whoa, is that big. Lemme change my font to something a little

more readable. How about 18? Looking good there.

Db 0. That's what we wrote here

our little Data Byte

0 and you can of course modify that and save it out and it will automatically save as test.asm,

the file that we have created.
I can look in that directory there.

DIR There see? There it is. test.asm Well, I'm just going to, for the

moment I'm going to say bye bye to that one. So that is Delete DEL T

Tab to autocomplete. Hit Enter, and now if I look in the directory it is gone. Zero bytes.

So I'm going to also go CD..

(CD period period) Enter, and that takes me up one folder.

And let me go DIR
There you can see there's

the Assembly folder we made earlier. I am going to RMDIR (remove directory)

the A Tab folder, Enter, and if I DIR again it is gone. We have erased everything that

we have begun with. So I can explain a little further what we just did.

So, let me just open a File Explorer here.
There.

There's our Documents folder. Once again, I will go just open a new window.

Windows special key R, CMD. There we are. And then put this where we can kind of see both of them

like that. There we go.

So if i go...

Let me just click out of the way here...

Directory here, I get a list of folders.

Not the same as what I'm seeing here. Because Windows takes you to this

folder full of shortcuts essentially. To actually see this we want to be down here under C:

Users, Your Name, and there. There is all the same thing that we're seeing there.

So I could go in Documents like that,

double click and as you can see I got some stuff and some files in there. And over here,

let me activate this window. I could go CD D O Tab, Enter,

and then DIR for the list of Directories, and there's my stuff and my files. You see?

Now, so from here, let me go

make a new directory, right? MKDIR Assembly. Okay? And then watch over here when I hit Enter.

Bada boom! See? It creates a new folder called Assembly. Nothing

in there. Let me open that. Folder's empty. So I could do the same here

CD A Tab, there. And now I'm in the Assembly folder. Okay? So once again, let's do what

we just did earlier. ECHO DB 0, put it into a new file called test.asm, and watch the folder folks!

Enter. There it is. We have created a new file in our new folder.

So you know, of course, I could double click here and launch and open Notepad and there it is. Yeah

so of course the old fashioned way. Let me just... I'm gonna go up here and just delete this whole

thing again real quick. Whoops! It can't because it's being used over here. Hang on a second

Close that. Excuse me.

There.

I am going to just delete this.

Okay. Same thing the old fashioned way. Of course, there is my Documents folder. I

could just go Right Click, New Folder, Assembly, Enter, and then double click and go in there .

Let's see... I don't have a shortcut for Notepad there, or you could use your favorite text editor,

but let's just go with what comes with Windows by default here.

I could type notepad in there, Enter.
There it is.

We go DB 0
Save As

in our Documents folder, in the Assembly folder we just created.

We're going to create a new file called test.asm .

Bada Boom! And let me just get that out of the way there it is

So same thing as old school, you know using the visual graphical references that we're used to.

But I'm trying to get you kind of into doing the Command Line because

we will be spending a bit of time there. So let's do that a bit here.

I think I'll close that for now.
We will Windows special key R,

the CMD is already in there because I did it before,

so I can just hit Enter, and we're back in the Command Line.

So some other ways we could do this;
I could go...

from here, let me go to my folder for starters

DIR (directory) CD DO Tab. I'm in Documents. Let's see the Directories.

There. There's my Assembly.
CD A Tab. Now I'm in Assembly

Now I want to create a new file. There's other ways to do it that comes by default

with Windows. I could just go CD. and create (>) a new file generic.asm,

Enter and...
maybe I did want my actual

File Explorer open. There, ok if I'm in Documents/Assembly.. There. We created generic.asm

There. Okay so...

Nothing in there.
What what was the point of that?

Well, I could write something in there from the Command Line. Again using that

ECHO command we used earlier, I could just go ECHO DB 1 and then Shift+6

and you get that little Caret. I'm going to go Enter and then Enter again,

if i want to do more than one line. I'm just gonna

write some code into there

Db 2

OK? And then this time I'm just going to go Space, and Arrow (>), and if I hit G Tab

it finds Name of File, and just hit Enter. There. And so now I have written some stuff

into my generic.asm file. Let's look at it.
I can go G tab from here and it looks for

something. Let's have a look. There. There's the code that I just pumped in there. You see?

Another thing I could do, let's see...

Oh! Or also I don't have to open Notepad to do that. I could also just go TYPE G Tab

and there. There's the contents of the

file right there. I can read it from the Command Line as well.

I'm going to do another ECHO here and write a little bit more extensive code for a second. DB

-72, 2, 9, and then Shift+6 for the Caret, Enter, Enter.

DB -69, 15, null (0)

Shift+6, Enter

and then...

oh, actually I wanted to just go... I'm done here. I'm going to go

Space

Arrow (>) and we'll put that in G Tab. There. Bada boom.

So let's have a look at G Tab now.

Yes or... hang on. I don't need to do that.

There it's there. But of course we know we can just... from the

Command Line we can just go TYPE G Tab. Whoom! You can see it overwrote

what was in there. See? It didn't ask me "oh, do you want to overwrite?" you know, in this case.

Another thing... Let me just start another one here. I'm going to go ECHO

and this time DB -71, 1, Null (0)

Shift+6, Enter, Enter

and then DB -51, 16

Space. Okay now, this time Arrow (>) I'm going to use 2 Arrows (>>)

Okay? and then we're going to write that into G Tab and hit Enter. Now if I go TYPE

G Tab, read it.. There. It appended. It added
it to the

text that's in here. See? The first bit AND the second bit are both in there. So

it "Concatenated",

added to. So if I use one arrow like that (>) it will overwrite what's in there. Right? and if you

use two little arrows like that (>>) it will add to the file. You see? Let's see, another thing...

I got a messy screen here. Let me just go CLS Enter. There. Ah! Nice and clean. Alright,

Another way I could make a file: let me go COPY CON

and get that mouse out of the way. I keep doing that.

COPY CON tempFile.asm

Okay, and then hit Enter, and now the blinky cursor is no longer at

the end of a Command Prompt.
So it's expecting some input.

So I can begin typing. I can go TIMES 499 DB 0 . Like that, and just hit Enter and now it will,

as you can see it's already created a file here that I'm still continuing to write into.

Lemme me do another line here.

DB 85, -86

Okay and then

add a Space here, and you can go Ctrl Z,

Enter. There. 1 file copied. So I have just created this

tempFile and wrote some code into it.
Let's TYPE TEM Tab tempFile... there.

There's the code that is in the tempFile. So

I could take that file that i just created, tempFile and rename it REN (rename)

TEM Tab tempFile to

something else. Here I'm gonna go prog2.asm

like that. There, and now it's been renamed.

This generic file up here, I could...

Use COPY
and go

G Tab. It finds generic. We'll call that prog1.asm

like that. There. And it makes a copy, and it keeps the original. And now I

have my prog1.asm, prog2.asm.
I can go here in the view

and turn file name extensions on. There.
That's a little better for programming,

I can see what type of file in there. Okay so I have my prog1.asm,

prog1.asm. I could go over here now and go
COPY P Tab prog1.asm + P tab, back

up (Backspace) I'll type 2 Tab. There. The two of those together into a newProg.asm, like that.

Doesn't matter, you can keep typing, it goes off onto a new line,

and just hit Enter.
There.

And it has created a new program here. Let's look at it from here shall we? TYPE N Tab Enter

and there is all of our concatenated code. It has combined the code from our first program

1 here these four lines, in our program 2 these two lines, into a new program, and

it's all together now. So that can be useful as well. See?

I would like to play around a little bit here some more. Let me go up one to Assembly here...

Say I want to get here to Assembly Directory. Instead of having to go from CD (change

directory) Documents, CD Assembly, I can go and Right Click here and copy this address,

and then I'm going to Windows special key R Enter. I'm going to just going

to go CD Space and Ctrl V to paste,
hit Enter, and now I am in that folder.

So that's kind of a quickie shortcut way to get there.

So I'm in Assembly.
I am going to just make a directory called Yo.

There. And if I look, there's my folder "directory" called Yo.

OK, So I've made my directory and want to move my save generic file here into Yo. So I can just type

MOVE G Tab into (space) Y Tab Enter. There. 1 file moved. My generic program is missing from here,

and if i go in there, there it is. You see. I have moved it into there. M'kay?

So let me go up 1. here's a little interesting thing. I can remove a Directory just

go RMDIR Y Tab ,Yo, and it says "the directory is not empty". Whoops. Yeah. So you could go

in there and delete the file and then go out and delete the directory, which is what I did earlier.

Because as you can see, you can't just delete it outright.

And then of course you know you go look it up online and they're like

"Ah! That is very simple! All you have to do is..."

here let me close this

"You go to Command Prompt like that and then

you'll go Run as Administrator. Oh yes. I want to make changes, Okay."

Now I got this... I'm in a different place for one thing. If I type DIR it's like WHOA!

There's like all the files on my computer. I don't like this Administrator thing already!

And so then I gotta do that thing that I just showed you to get here copy the address,

go CD Ctrl V. There, now we're where I was before, There. Okay, Yo! I want to delete Yo, OK?

RMDIR Y tab, delete Yo! "Directory...whoa well thanks a lot a guy on the internet who knows

nothing, and just speaks with such authority, you know, and has a ton of ads on his channel full of

misinformation. Thanks. Yes you're very helpful. No. The way you do it.

Let's see, you just have to go...

Here, forget this administrator thing.
Let me just go back to normal

Command Prompt. There!
Not in administrator mode. Sorry I'm

getting a little riled up here.
I'm going to go CD DO Tab. There.

Let's see where we got in there. Some stuff. I'm trying to delete this Assembly

folder which has some stuff in it and the way you do that, just go RMDIR name of folder... right?

Oh wait wait, actually that is not the one I want to delete. Hang on hang on hang on. I want

to be delete the one that's in there cause we're going to use this other one later .

There it is. Okay DIR I want to delete Yo and as it has got a file in there,

a sample file just to demonstrate the futility of trying to do this.

so RMDIR

Y Tab remove dir. Okay but it's just going to say "no, can't do it" so what you do is you go

/s okay, and then it goes "Yo, are you sure?"

Like no! Gosh darn it let me forget that. (n) The way you really do it you go RMDIR and you

tell it the name of file, name of folder, and then you tell it to shut up and be quiet (/s/q).

Okay? There. And now it just does it without complaining. The folder Yo has disappeared

along with it's contents too. So there we have done it like a regular adult, you know.

So another

Let's say I got this new program you know, and I'm happy with it now,

and I want to save it into a new folder, right?
Another way to do that from down here, I can go

XCOPY
and it's newProg.asm

and

I can put it into a new folder.
We'll call it Tutorial and

backslash

so it was going to go in the folder, and I can also give it a new name

01_firstProg.asm

Okay, so let's see. Hit Enter

and then it asks "File or Directory?" so if you type D it will name...

it'll create a folder called 01_firstProg.asm and then put

01_firstProg.asm in the folder called 01_firstProg.asm which is kind of

confusing. I don't even know why they give you that option. You just type F and there. So now it

has automatically for all that short line of code a complicated explanation, it has automatically

taken the program that we wanted to save,
created a folder called Tutorial and in

there has written the program that we're happy with by a new name. There.

So let me just go up here now and...

Let's use what we've just learned here and remove the... Here first let me see what we got.

DIR there. Okay I just want to remove all of this stuff except

for the Tutorial folder that we created in the first exercise so what does that? RMDIR

Oh, I'm sorry. No.

I have only files to delete DEL N (newProg) gone. DEL P Tab gone. DEL another P Tab gone. And

test can stay. Test can stay and yeah, yeah, Tutorial can go. We're going to keep

test because that was the first lesson. Alright, and what was it? RMDIR TU Tab.

If I type T it might find test which we don't want. We wanted to find Tutorial

RMDIR and we want to tell it to shut up and be quiet (/s/q) Gone. All gone.

Okay and we're back to the end of lesson 1 you may continue on with the next tutorial.
